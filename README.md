### A webapplication for a fictive developer business.

Built with React, CSS, Formik, MUI icons and emailJS.

This was an assignment for a 3 week projects course called "projects with agile methods".

#### First steps:

First off we as a team sat down and discussed the plan for this project.
Made a backlog using the SCRUM wireframe in Jira, and then went on and created a application wireframe using Figma:
